Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, Glutei, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it\'s slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and Spalle more.

It is performed by pressing downward on the knee pad of the machine, against the resistance of the weight. It approximates the motion of a Tricipiti cable rope push-down, but with open hands.

The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for Forza or higher reps for muscle and Forza endurance.
